        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Annabelle Cotton is a dedicated and compassionate young woman preparing to graduate high school and begin an exciting new chapter in her life. Throughout her high school years, she balanced academics with her love for softball, a sport that taught her teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. One of her proudest accomplishments has been gaining hands-on experience working part-time with a veterinarian, an opportunity that strengthened her passion for animal care and confirmed her desire to pursue a career in veterinary medicine.
Annabelle’s love for dogs and her lifelong connection with animals inspired her to follow the path of becoming a veterinarian. She is eager to begin college this fall, where she looks forward to learning everything she can about animal science, behavior, and medical care. Rather than focusing on one specialty, she is excited by the entire field and hopes to eventually work with small animals in a professional veterinary setting.
As she prepares for college, Annabelle is motivated by the independence and new experiences that lie ahead. She knows challenges will come, but she feels confident knowing she has a strong support system in her family. Her job at the grocery store has played a meaningful role in her growth, helping her develop responsibility, communication skills, and the ability to work with people in a caring and sensitive way.
Driven by a passion she has carried since freshman year, Annabelle is committed to helping animals and building a future where she can make a positive impact every day.
